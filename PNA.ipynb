This method is especially useful in continuous states RL problems as the number of (state, action) pairs is very large and thus impossible to store and learn this information. By choosing a particular k-values and decided some initial points over continuous states, one can estimate Q values based on calculated the weighted average of Q values of the k-nearest neighbours for the state that the agent are currently in and use that values to decide the next move using some decision methods (i.e. UCB or epsilon-greedy). As for the learning process, one can update all of the k-nearest neighbours that contribute for the Q calculation.\n",
